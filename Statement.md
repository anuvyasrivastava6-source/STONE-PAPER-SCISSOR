Problem Statement
To design and implement a simple interactive game—Stone-Paper-Scissor—where the user competes against the computer. The game should take input from the player, generate a random choice for the computer, and then determine the outcome based on standard rules.

Scope of the Project
The game runs on a command-line interface
Single-player mode (User vs Computer)
Uses randomization for fairness
Demonstrates basic Python programming and conditional logic
Target Users
Beginners learning Python
Students doing academic projects
Anyone who wants to play a quick game on terminal
High-Level Features
Input handling and case-insensitive comparison
Randomized computer choice
Immediate feedback on results:
Win
Lose
Tie
Simple and lightweight design
